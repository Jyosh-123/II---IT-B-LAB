# AIM 0F THE EXPERIMENT: Arranging the given elements in sorted array using bubblesort.

## DESCRIPTION:
   Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements
   and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort,
  is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

### STEP TO STEP PROCEDURE:

     1.firstly, we have to declare an array with a specific number of elements.
     2.then we have to compare the adjacent two elements starting from the initial position.
     3.if the first element is greater than the second element we have to swap them.if not we have to consider the next two
       adjacent elements
     4.this process continues untill the whole array gets sorted.
     5.once the array gets sorted we need to print them.
     
#### OUTPUT OBTAINED:
   
   OUTPUT1:
        we have to declare an array as[3,4,1,78,98,36].by going through the function bubble sort it checks whether the given array is sorted or not.
       if it is n0t sorted then the adjacent elements get swapped if the 1at element is greater than second and continues till the whole array gets sorted 
       and gives the output as [1,3,4,36,78,98]
       
   OUTPUT2:
       we have to declare an array as[1,3,5,6,8,2,4,-3,9,-5].by going through the function bubble sort it checks whether the given array is sorted or not.
       if it is n0t sorted then the adjacent elements get swapped if the 1at element is greater than second and continues till the whole array gets sorted 
       and gives the output as [-5,-3,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9].in this case we can see that the negative integers also get sorted.
       
   OUTPUT3:
       we have to declare an array as[1,34,56,67,78,89].by going through the function bubble sort it checks whether the given array is sorted or not.
       In this case we can see that the given array is already sorted.so we cna get the output as[1,34,56,67,78,89]

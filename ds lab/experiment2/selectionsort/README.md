# AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT : TO arrange the given array in sorted order using selection sort

## DESCRIPTION : Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts,
the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.

### STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:
   1.we have to declare an array.
   2.we have to check whether the given array is sorted or not.
   3.if it is not sorted we have to check the each element with the remaining elements.if the first element is greater than the other elements 
     then we have to interchange the elements position and this process continues till the all elements get sorted
     
#### OUTPUT OBTAINED:
   
     OUTPUT 1: 
          1.First we have to declare an array as a={3,4,2,1,12,9}
          2.here the array is not sorted then  we have to check the each element with the remaining elements.if the first element is greater than the other elements 
            then we have to interchange the elements position and this process continues till the all elements get sorted
          3. hence we get the final array in sorted array as a={1,2,3,4,9,12}
          
     OUTPUT 2:
          1.In this case we have to take a sorted array as a={1,2,3,4,5,6}
          2.though the array is sorted we have to check the each element with the remaining elements.if the first element is greater than the other elements 
            then we have to interchange the elements position and this process continues till the all elements get sorted
          3.but here the elements are sorted . hence we get the output as a={1,2,3,4,5,6}
          
     OUTPUT 3:
          1.In this case we have to take an array consists of repeating elements as a={1,2,3,5,5,4}
          2.here the array is not sorted then  we have to check the each element with the remaining elements.if the first element is greater than the other elements 
            then we have to interchange the elements position and this process continues till the all elements get sorted
          3.though it consists of repeating elements we get an array which is in sorted array .hence the output is a={1,2,3,4,5,5}

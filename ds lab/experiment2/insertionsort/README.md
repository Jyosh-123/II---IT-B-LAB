# AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT: To arrange the given elements in ascending order using insertion sort
## DESCRIPTION:Insertion sort algorithm picks elements one by one and places it to the right position where it belongs in the sorted list of elements.
### STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:
     1.First we have to declare an array of given size.
     2.Then we have to check whether the given array is sorted or not.if it is sorted it will print the array .
     3.If it is not sorted it will go to the insertion_sort function
     4.Here we will assume that the first element i.e..a[0] itself is the largest element and compare with the remaining elements
     5.If the current element is lesser then previous element the current element is inserted in previous element position.
     6.Like this,it will check all the previous elements with the current element position untill the array gets sorted.
#### OUTPUT OBTAINED:

    OUTPUT1: 
      1.First we have to declare an array of size 6
      2.Here the given array is not sorted then it goes to the else condition and  assume that the first element i.e..a[0] itself is
        the largest element and compare with the remaining elements
      3.If the current element is lesser then previous element the current element is inserted in previous element position.
      4.Like this,it will check all the previous elements with the current element position untill the array gets sorted.
      5.thus the output obtained in sorted order
      
    OUTPUT2:
      1.First we have to declare an array of size 6
      2.here the given array is sorted so that the curser goes to the if condition and satisfies.
      3.hence we get the output as sorted order.
      
    OTPUT3:
      1.First we have to declare an array of size 6
      2.here the declared array contains repeating elements.though it contains repeated elements it does not undergo any special
        condition it will go through the same procedure as above.
      3.So we will get the output array in sorted array.
      
      
      
  ![output1](insertionsort1)
  ![output2](insertionsort2)
  ![output3](insertionsort3)
